# Lab3_ITMD361
3rd Lab in ITMD 361

UPDATE: "main" branch is set to default, however it is NOT the one used to publish my website for this lab.
I had some issues with my website publishing incorrectly, and for some reason I wasn't able to make changes or publish the website within the "main" branch. The "save" option prior to publishing is grayed out.
For this reason, I made a couple more branches as a test and buffer for my current files. (Wanted to delete, keep edit history, etc)

I used "BranchV2" to delete the file saved as "index" (NOT index.html) because this file was causing errors during the publishing. 
However, I want this file to be present somewhere (hence the other branches) because it contains all my push/pull commits and work history for this lab.
I know this is unorganized, however after re-doing this lab twice I am just making sure to deliver something that "works."
All the HTML code and website should be fine, this was just an error on my end in terms of saving the files appropriately and whatnot.
I will make sure that these issues do not arise in future labs.
